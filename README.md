##Spam Detection Using Naive Bayes – Detailed Project Description
This task involves the development of a spam message detection system using a supervised machine learning approach. The core objective is to classify text messages (SMS) into “ham” (non-spam) or “spam” using the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is well-suited for text classification tasks. This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model evaluation, using Python and its scientific libraries.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python: A general-purpose programming language chosen for its simplicity and extensive library support for machine learning and data analysis.

Pandas: Used for loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset. It helps convert CSV data into a structured DataFrame.

Seaborn and Matplotlib: Visualization libraries used to plot data distributions and confusion matrices for evaluating the model's performance.

scikit-learn (sklearn): A powerful machine learning library that provides tools for:

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Feature extraction using CountVectorizer, which converts text into a matrix of token counts.

Training the model using the MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes) classifier.

Evaluating the model using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Dataset Used
The dataset used here is spam.csv, which is a collection of SMS messages labeled either as ‘ham’ (legitimate message) or ‘spam’ (unsolicited message). It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is a well-known benchmark for spam detection models.

The dataset structure:

v1: Label column (ham or spam)

v2: The actual SMS message content

For simplicity and clarity, the columns are renamed to label and text.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

The labels are mapped to binary values: ham → 0, spam → 1.

A visual plot of label distribution is created to understand the class imbalance, if any.

Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using an 80-20 split to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

Text Vectorization:

Since machine learning models cannot work directly with raw text, CountVectorizer is used to transform the text messages into a matrix of token counts (bag-of-words model).

Model Training:

The MultinomialNB classifier is trained on the vectorized training data. This algorithm is ideal for text classification tasks where word frequencies play a crucial role.

Model Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the test set, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

A confusion matrix is visualized using Seaborn to show true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Applications
This task has practical relevance in several domains:

Email and SMS filtering systems to block spam messages.

Customer service bots to detect irrelevant or abusive content.

Social media monitoring to filter spam comments.

Enterprise communication systems for secure message screening.

Conclusion
This spam detection task illustrates a complete end-to-end text classification pipeline. By combining text preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning, it provides a foundational understanding of how spam filters work. The model can be further improved with more advanced techniques like TF-IDF, stemming/lemmatization, or deep learning-based NLP methods such as LSTM or BERT.
